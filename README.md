# TASK-2

This project includes an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) pipeline aimed at understanding the dataset using summary statistics and insightful visualizations. The analysis was performed using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

This project performs exploratory data analysis on titanic dataset using:

1.Pandas for loading the dataset and generating summary statistics (describe())

2.Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing:

   * Histograms to check the distribution of numeric features

   * Boxplots to detect outliers and spread

   * Correlation matrix using a heatmap to show relationships between features

   * Pairplots for pairwise feature relationships

   * Scatterplots to identify trends or clusters in feature pairs

3.Plotly Express for creating interactive scatterplots

The goal is to quickly understand feature distributions, relationships, and any anomalies or patterns present in the data before further analysis or modeling.
